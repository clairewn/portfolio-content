            <h3>Project: Data Analytics Tool for Optimal Work Allocation</h3>
            <p>This is a current project that recently started this month. I will be working on this project
                for one year from Jan 2022 to Dec 2022. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning 
                forecasting model that can provide business users with insights on allocating processor to handle 
                incoming workload. This project will require me to do a lot of self-learning on AWS and ML. I am 
                really looking forward to working on this project.

            <li><h2>Undergraduate Software Researcher - University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute</h2></li>
            <h3>Project: Data Elements from Video Using Impartial Algorithm Tools for Extraction</h3>
            <p>I helped develop a software labeling tool to accelerate human video coding and labeling by 
                tracking objects throughout video frames. I redesigned exportation of data into JSON files to
                simplify the data analysis process. I utilized the PyQt5 library to improve UI and provide
                better user feedback as well as implement more intuitive controls. I programmed necessary 
                functional components in Python while abstracting away irrelevant use cases, simplifying 
                complexity, and re-organizing object data results into testable and efficient code. I guided
                unit testing and organized written documentation to coordinate task management. I was awarded
                as winner of the 2021 Intelligent Transportation Society Michigan Student Poster Competition.

            <li><h2>Digital Web Intern - Harman International</h2></li>
            <p>My main project was working on the migration of Sharepoint sites to the new version. I communicated
                personally with over 500 site owners to guide Sharepoint site migrations to receive higher response 
                rates. I updated internal company Sharepoint sites by responding to Web Team ticket requests and increased
                site ratings by 15 points. I thoroughly tested several applications while updating issue tracker by priority. 
                I created concise guides for IT software applications to allow users to more easily understand and adapt
                to new technologies.

            <li><h2>PR/Marketing Intern - The Borgen Project</h2></li>
            <p>My main project was on leading a local branding and marketing campaign to fundraise over $1000 to aid
                relief efforts in reducing global poverty. I consolidated information and updates into a website for 
                the Borgen Project Running Fundraiser. I published and designed informational media such as inforgraphics
                and videos on a weekly basis. I moderated focus groups to improve non-profit website's usability.
