        <p>Besides taking pictures of nature and wildlife, Dad likes to take pictures of the rest of us as well. 
            He has always loved taking pictures of us since I was very little. 
            We have lots of videos and photos from childhood that are a classic.
            He came to every single of my sports competitions and my brothers' to take pictures of the whole team.
            That means we have always all got really nice pictures.
            Unfortunately that means he's not in a lot of pictures.
        </p>

        <p>The rest of the family also loves taking pictures too. That means that occasionally Dad will make it in the pictures!
            Here are instances where my dad caught us all taking pictures and a photo where he makes it in.
