				<figcaption>I've played piano for 16 years. I have always enjoyed performing and
					some highlights include performing in a castle in Italy, performing in the 
					Honors Recital at the International Institute for Young Musicians, and performing
					Rhapsody in Blue with my school band. I've recently started playing in a trio 
					and I really enjoy playing with this group.

		<h1>Sports:</h1>
			<h2>Triathlon</h2>

			<h3>Swimming</h3>

				<img src = "images/swim2.jpg" alt = "my friend and I getting ready for our open swim"/>
				<figcaption>I started competitively swimming since I was 8 and it has always come really
					easy to me and I've really enjoyed it. Open water swimming is definitely very different
					from swimming in a pool, but I'll get used to it.

			<h3>Running</h3>

				<img src = "images/run1.jpg" alt = "runners heading towards the finish line"/>
				<img src = "images/run2.jpg" alt = "after race feeling dizzy"/>
				<figcaption>I have run all different distances before, however, I am usually more successful
					in short sprints. I am trying to improve my endurance, since triathlon running distances
					are pretty long.

			<h3>Biking</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src = "images/bike1.jpg" alt = "first time on a borrowed road bike"/>
				<img src = "images/bike2.jpg" alt = "training on my own indoor bike"/>
				<figcaption>I have always enjoyed biking recreationally, but I used a road bike for the first 
					time in my first triathlon ever and it was really fast and fun. I've gotten into biking a
					lot more now and even have my own road bike.
