		<p>I am a student at the University of Michigan pursuing a dual degree in Information and Cognitive 
            Science while minoring in Computer Science. Some classes I have taken include Data Structures & 
            Algorithms, Introduction to Machine Learning for NLP, Data Manipulation, and Decision Processes.
            I am also currently working as an Emerging Talent Intern at JPMorgan Chase for the next year. 
            Other jobs I currently hold include being a Computer Science tutor, a Honors Housing Leader, and 
            Information mentor. I am still exploring different career paths, but I am definitely passionate
            about working with technology and people.</p>

		<p>Outside of academics, I am very involved with music. I play the flute in the Michigan Pops Orchestra 
            and play piano in a trio. I am on E-board for the University Musical Society Student Committee. 
            Other than music, I also am part of triathlon and running club, and I enjoy lifting. 
            I also enjoy spending time with my family, friends, and dog.
