		<p>Over the summer, my family went to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park.
			It was an amazing and beautiful trip, and I wanted to share some of the pictures.
			My dad takes really great photos, and I wanted to be able to share them somewhere in some way.
			He brought 3 cameras on the trip and took a lot of really cool pictures of the landscape.
			We were also lucky and managed to see a lot of wildlife and got some really cool pictures of them too.
			This site just showcases some of the really cool things we got to see that my dad captured really well.

		<p>Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park are located in the northwest corner of Wyoming.
			We flew into Jackson Hole and drove to the two national parks.
			We started in Grand Teton and then Yellowstone. 
			Yellowstone is the oldest national park and its most famous attraction is Old Faithful geyser.
			We spent one week exploring these parks before driving back through Grand Teton to Jackson Hole.
